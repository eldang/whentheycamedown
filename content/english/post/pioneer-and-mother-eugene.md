The Pioneer and Pioneer Mother statues were torn down by protesters at the University of Oregon.

<!--more-->

The Pioneer and Pioneer Mother statues were both sculpted by Alexander Phimister Proctor and installed in 1919 and 1932, respectively.[^1] They joined [a statue of Thomas Jefferson](../jefferson-portland/) in Portland as two of three statues torn down in Oregon during police brutality protests over the weekend.[^2]

These statues have been subject to previous vandalism. In 2019, the Pioneer statue was symbolically painted red on its whip and crotch.[^3] The University had also explored removing the statue after controvery by forming a committee to address controversial monuments.[^4] Protesters instead took direct action.[^5] Removal of the statue was part of demonstrators' demands.[^6]
